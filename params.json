{"name":"Derrell Beasley","tagline":"My Projects","body":"###\r\n![Derrell Beasley](http://i.imgur.com/DFIyxYr.jpg)\r\nHello my name is Derrell Beasley, and as you might have guessed this is my GitHub.\r\n\r\n### **What's Here?**\r\nMost of the things you will find here are the various projects that i have been working on. It should be noted that almost all the models in the project files are from the website TF3DM, unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\nThe projects so far...\r\n_Road to Heaven, Chaos Fang, 2D Space Shooter, Space Invaders Clone, Zombie Sims, Jump Drive, and Random Trait System (for Unity Asset Store)_ \r\nYou can find descriptions for each below.\r\n\r\n### **Who the heck is Derrell Beasley?**\r\nGlad you asked! I'm a game designer primarily, though I did pick up programming a couple years back. I'm currently 26 years old, spent a couple years in the Army then decided to go to college for Game Design in Austin, Texas. There i picked up a little C++ (really just the basics), knowledge with various game engines such as Unity, Vicious, UDK, and XNA. Some basic art skills (though you would be hard pressed to find evidence of that) in Photoshop, Mudbox, 3Ds Max, Maya.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief hiatus back to government work (IRS) and a change of major to Psychology, I decided to go back to Game Design. Over that period I picked up some cool Object Oriented Programming Design patterns, C# with some .Net framework thrown in for good measure. A little bit more Game Theory, better technical art skills, Mobile hardware, Console hardware, PC hardware and why Nvidia's Quadro cards are so expensive.  \r\n\r\nTurns out, I accidentally made myself pretty well rounded. Which means there is still quite a few gaps that still need filling in. That's why I'm here. \r\n\r\n### **Zombie Sim (10,000)**\r\n![10,000](http://i.imgur.com/c4zVNLU.png)\r\nI created this simple Zombie Sim for 2 reasons. One was to get used to using XNA and another was to try out a design pattern called Spatial Partitioning. The goal was to has 10,000 creatures on screen at once checking for collisions while maintaining 60fps and being single threaded.\r\n\r\nJust for fun I made them cute and added some special things. The red angry faces have weapons and can fight the zombies. If they manage to kill a zombie, the get better at killing zombies and their chance of being bitten goes down. The yellow ones are just kinda screwed. The Simulation starts with only 1 zombie, yet every thing is infected in approximately 60 secs.\r\n \r\n### **Road to Heaven (Current Project)**\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/gWGCTdu.jpg)\r\n**Update*** I'm rewriting the code for Road to Heaven in C#. While also fixing a lot of design pattern issues with the code. I will be switching from using PlayerPrefs to using XML serialization to save data, better use of polymorphism, events, and encapsulation. It will be called Road to Heaven V2; since the changes are drastic even at the beginning stages I might just put it into it's own section. **End Update**\r\n\r\n![Trait System from Road To Heaven on Asset Store](http://i.imgur.com/fHfSov9.png)\r\nSuccessfully got this into the Asset Store.\r\n\r\nA simple idea for an FPS game and a coding exercise. You have 30 mins to kill and collect 10,000 souls or you will be stuck in purgatory forever (or at least until you quit). Every thing you kill grants you some additional to that death clock (based of the health of the creature you kill. Which so are the amount of souls you collect). \r\n\r\nThere isn't a health system for the player at all. Damage done to the player takes away for the remaining time you have to live. What about upgrades? Yes, there are upgrades in the game. The player can bribe an Angel or Demon with parts of their soul (which again, is the time you have to live) in exchange for abilities. More powerful abilities will take a bigger chunk of your soul.\r\n\r\nThe game is a wager the player makes with themselves. If they sell 15 minutes worth of the time for superPower02, do they believe they can get the return of that investment by collecting enough souls, thus giving them more time, to offset the cost. \r\n\r\nAnd the more souls you have, the more they effect you. Every 500 souls gives the player a new random trait. The trait can be good such as <jump twice as high> or bad such as <You can't jump at all>. The traits stack with each other, by the end the player will have 20 of them. Since it is random, it forces the play-through to be different every time.\r\n\r\n### **Jump Drive**\r\n![Jump Drive](http://i.imgur.com/VD1lWXA.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis was my first foray into C#. It was also meant to be a test with Unity Physics and to see hard it would be to make something that resembled a game in Unity. This was when I realized that I really need to program.\r\n\r\n![Unity's old GUI](http://i.imgur.com/CpmT9Ty.png)\r\n\r\n### **Chaos Fang (Pet Project)**\r\n![Chaos Fang](http://i.imgur.com/aoFiCW5.jpg)\r\nA very important game to me. If money were no issue, this would be the game that I would make right now. This was the first project that I was really passionate about that failed. I lead a small team of 10 for this project. I designed the combat system, the levels, wrote the story, cut-scenes, character design, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat I didn't count on was the sheer learning curve of UDK. That is what me and my team spent most of time doing instead of making the game. Though to be fair, I did learn an amazing amount by jumping head first into the fire.\r\n\r\n![Learning World Machine](http://i.imgur.com/408Qyvt.png)\r\nLearning World & MudBox.\r\n\r\n![Building Levels](http://i.imgur.com/x9ohs5K.png)\r\nTerrain from above in UDK.\r\n\r\n![Level Design](http://i.imgur.com/5QF4xnz.png)\r\nSome level design.\r\n\r\n![Block Out for Combat System](http://i.imgur.com/qGTFhqw.png)\r\nA basic block out for the combat system.\r\n\r\n### **2D Space Shooter & Space Invaders Clone**\r\n![2D Space Shooter](http://i.imgur.com/aRLJ5Tj.png)\r\n![Space Invaders Clone](http://i.imgur.com/DonfzE7.png)\r\n\r\nBoth games are exactly what they sound like. Simple, easy games.\r\n\r\n### **Contact Me**\r\nIf I need to be contacted for some reason, I can be reached at **derrell.beasleyfo@hotmail.com**.
