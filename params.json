{"name":"Autree.github.io","tagline":"A GitHub for Derrell Beasley","body":"### **Welcome to my GitHub.**\r\nHello my name is Derrell Beasley, and as you might have guessed this is my GitHub.\r\n\r\n### **What's Here?**\r\nMost of the things you will find here are the various projects that i have been working on. It should be noted that almost all the models in the project files are from the website TF3DM, unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\nThe projects so far...\r\n_Road to Heaven, Chaos Fang, 2D Space Shooter, Space Invaders Clone, and Random Trait System (for Unity Asset Store)_ \r\nYou can find descriptions for each below.\r\n\r\n### **Who the heck is Derrell Beasley?**\r\nGlad you asked! I'm a game designer primarily, though I did pick up programming a couple years back. I'm currently 26 years old, spent a couple years in the Army then decided to go to college for Game Design in Austin, Texas. There i picked up a little C++ (really just the basics), knowledge with various game engines such as Unity, Vicious, UDK, and XNA. Some basic art skills (though you would be hard pressed to find evidence of that) in Photoshop, Mudbox, 3Ds Max, Maya.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief hiatus back to government work (IRS) and a change of major to Psychology, I decided to go back to Game Design. Over that period I picked up some cool Object Oriented Programming Design patterns, C# with some .Net framework thrown in for good measure. A little bit more Game Theory, better technical art skills, Mobile hardware, Console hardware, PC hardware and why Nvidia's Quadro cards are so expensive.  \r\n\r\nTurns out, I accidentally made myself pretty well rounded. Which means there is still quite a few gaps that still need filling in. That's why I'm here. \r\n \r\n### **Road to Heaven (Current Project)**\r\n![Diablo 3 Image](http://i.imgur.com/q5HJF2z.jpg)\r\nA simple idea for an FPS game and a coding exercise. You have 30 mins to kill and collect 10,000 souls or you will be stuck in purgatory forever (or at least until you quit). Every thing you kill grants you some additional to that death clock (based of the health of the creature you kill. Which so are the amount of souls you collect). \r\n\r\nThere isn't a health system for the player at all. Damage done to the player takes away for the remaining time you have to live. What about upgrades? Yes, there are upgrades in the game. The player can bribe an Angel or Demon with parts of their soul (which again, is the time you have to live) in exchange for abilities. More powerful abilities will take a bigger chunk of your soul.\r\n\r\nThe game is a wager the player makes with themselves. If they sell 15 minutes worth of the time for superPower02, do they believe they can get the return of that investment by collecting enough souls, thus giving them more time, to offset the cost. \r\n\r\nAnd the more souls you have, the more they effect you. Every 500 souls gives the player a new random trait. The trait can be good such as <jump twice as high> or bad such as <You can't jump at all>. The traits stack with each other, by the end the player will have 20 of them. Since it is random, it forces the play-through to be different every time.\r\n\r\n### **Chaos Fang (Pet Project)**\r\n![Chaos Fang](http://i.imgur.com/aoFiCW5.jpg)\r\nA very important game to me. If money were no issue, this would be the game that I would make right now. Below is a five minutes of gameplay.\r\n\r\nThe War of Northern Aggression, Kenson the Chaotic Wind and Mico the White Flame. \r\n\r\n     You walk down the street seeing your body sway to the movement. You look down to check your inventory and see your short sword. Beautifully engraved with your clan's symbol, the chaotic wind, on your right side with its reassuring weight; with five short daggers strung across a small leather band on left of your hip. Satisfied with what you see, you look up to survey your surroundings. The town you just entered is small and ancient, yet, busy bristling with people going about their daily lives. As you walk through this town you realize its inhabitants are either staring at you or completely ignoring you all together. Which is to be expected since you are an outsider and you don't resemble anyone who lives in this part of Hruo. In the distance you see a sense of recognition come across a young man's face, quickly he disappears into a building.\r\n\r\n     Behind you a bell sounds, you start to realize that it's more than just a bell; it seems to be a warning. All of the town's inhabitants are quickly leaving the streets. You guess that young man did recognize you, or at least the legends about you, which is fine; it means you won't have to waste time looking for who you came to this small town to find. She's going to find you.\r\n\r\n     As if no one was ever there, the streets are empty. There are still toys from the children playing, fires burning from the street chefs cooking, and a rocking chair still rocking from its previous occupant. Thankfully you don't have to wait long, your legend never spoke of your patience.\r\n\r\n     She steps out from the building your new acquaintance entered; at first glance you think maybe it isn't her. This woman looks to innocent, to pristine to be a part of this eternal conflict. She doesn't seem like a woman who would carry the name The White flame, or the title of the most dangerous person in the eastern section of Hruo. She wears a long flowing blue robe, covered in intricate blood red flowers. The sort of detail the common person would not be privy to, nor would take the enormous amount of time that it must have taken to create it. This woman looks of royalty or something rather close.\r\n\r\n     She saunters into the middle of the street and stops. The doubt that it is not her has all but fled from your mind, especially with everyone else leaving this impromptu battlefield. She looks up at you, her eyes are as red as the flowers covering her robe. She reaches for her waist. You preemptively react to the movement, in one simple fluid motion withdrawing your sword in one hand and a dagger in the other. She catches the movement and smiles, as she undoes the belt around her robe, letting her expense robe drop to the ground. You see a large red bird tattoo extending from her neck to her right shoulder, the mark of the Dairu, the Phoenix Flame. She is indeed who you are looking for, the person you came here to kill.\r\n\r\n     You quickly throw the dagger at her head, hoping to quickly put an end to this, but you know it won't be so simple. She effortlessly glides out of the way, the dagger harmlessly sticking into a merchant's cart. She begins to withdraw her long katana, as she does you hear a soft click then a long grind like stone on metal. You have heard of this before, it has been said that she carried her black onyx sword bathed in a flammable liquid and at hilt there was a flint stone set to ignite the sword as it is  was withdrawn. Not waiting to see if the rumors were true you start to run at her, using your speed to quickly close the distance.\r\n \r\n    She seemed surprised by your ability to close the distance; it's obvious she wasn't expecting such speed. You seek to capitalize on her surprise, you start to raise your sword in an upward slash intended to sever her body in two. Yet she seemed to anticipate this, her katana burst into flames and she raised it to block your attack. Locked sword to sword she looks you in your eyes and smiles yet again. But this time upon close inspection you see her smile is not innocent at all, there's fire buried beneath her deceptive facade, she is obviously anticipating the battle to come. \r\n\r\n\tShe quickly drawls her hand across the backside of the blade, as her hand moves down the blade the fire seems to travel with it. The blade flickers out yet you see the fire is not gone just transferred to her hand. You quickly jump back in an attempt to gain back some of the distance you just traveled. You dive into a backwards roll just as she releases the ball of fire. It barely misses, if only you were a second slower you would be dead. You regain your composure as you see her draw her hand back across the blade reigniting it. Yet for some reason the flames seem bigger and brighter. You realize this is not a fight you can win in close combat unless you can neutralize that fire which seems to come from the liquid on the blade.\r\n \r\n    You jump back again as she runs her hands down the blade extinguishing the flame. You unhook another dagger and throw it in hopes of breaking her concentration, you compensated for her attempting to dodge, but to your dismay she stood still and you missed. She throws another ball of fire at you, this one bigger than before and noticeably brighter. This one you cannot dodge on your own, your surprised that one would make you resort to using your clan's abilities. The thought is almost insufferable, but she is not the head of the Dairu clan for nothing. \r\n\r\n    You quickly threw another dagger in her direction. With the approaching ball of fire getting closer, you dash after the dagger as if trying to catch it. You use your Clan's signature style to ride the vacant air broken by the dagger's aerodynamic body. As the dagger passes by her you snatch it out of the air to stop your movement, behind her. You quickly bring your sword bear in an attempt to cut her from behind. As you are bringing your sword too she senses that something isn't right having seen a strange form pass by her quickly. She turns just in time to evade your sudden attack. You managed to land a blow just before she fully was in a position to block it, in spite of her quick reflexes, deeply cutting her arm.\r\n\r\n     She jumps back away from you, clutching her wounded arm, again surprised at your speed. She reignites her blade and puts the flickering flames near her new wound cauterizing it. Her face shows no pain nor does she seem to notice the smell her flesh burning. You’re now aware that your intuition was right the last time; her blade is now bright orange from the heat of the flame. The flames of the blade are now leaping wildly several times larger than the width of the blade. They seem to be taking on a whitish color. Now you understand why they call her the White Flame.\r\n\r\n     This time it’s your turn to smile, this fight is going to take much more than you initially thought. You quickly undo the vest you are wearing and it drops to the ground with a heavy thud burying itself within. Now you feel free without the heavily weighted training vest slowing you down. She starts to run her hand along the blade...\r\n\r\n### **2D Space Shooter & Space Invaders Clone**\r\nBoth games are exactly what they sound like.
