<p>Hello my name is Derrell Beasley, and as you might have guessed this is my GitHub.</p>

</h3>

<p>Most of the things you will find here are the various projects that i have been working on. It should be noted that almost all the models in the project files are from the website TF3DM, unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p>The projects so far...
<em>Road to Heaven, Chaos Fang, 2D Space Shooter, Space Invaders Clone, and Random Trait System (for Unity Asset Store)</em> 
You can find descriptions for each below.</p>

</h3>

<p>Glad you asked! I'm a game designer primarily, though I did pick up programming a couple years back. I'm currently 26 years old, spent a couple years in the Army then decided to go to college for Game Design in Austin, Texas. There i picked up a little C++ (really just the basics), knowledge with various game engines such as Unity, Vicious, UDK, and XNA. Some basic art skills (though you would be hard pressed to find evidence of that) in Photoshop, Mudbox, 3Ds Max, Maya.</p>

<p>After a brief hiatus back to government work (IRS) and a change of major to Psychology, I decided to go back to Game Design. Over that period I picked up some cool Object Oriented Programming Design patterns, C# with some .Net framework thrown in for good measure. A little bit more Game Theory, better technical art skills, Mobile hardware, Console hardware, PC hardware and why Nvidia's Quadro cards are so expensive.  </p>

<p>Turns out, I accidentally made myself pretty well rounded. Which means there is still quite a few gaps that still need filling in. That's why I'm here. </p>

</h3>

<p><em>Road to Heaven:</em> A simple idea for an FPS game and a coding exercise. You have 30 mins to kill and collect 10,000 souls or you will be stuck in purgatory forever (or at least until you quit). Every thing you kill grants you some additional to that death clock (based of the health of the creature you kill. Which so are the amount of souls you collect). </p>

<p>There isn't a health system for the player at all. Damage done to the player takes away for the remaining time you have to live. What about upgrades? Yes, there are upgrades in the game. The player can bribe an Angel or Demon with parts of their soul (which again, is the time you have to live) in exchange for abilities. More powerful abilities will take a bigger chunk of your soul.</p>

<p>The game is a wager the player makes with themselves. If they sell 15 minutes worth of the time for superPower02, do they believe they can get the return of that investment by collecting enough souls, thus giving them more time, to offset the cost. </p>

<p>And the more souls you have, the more they effect you. Every 500 souls gives the player a new random trait. The trait can be good such as  or bad such as . The traits stack with each other, by the end the player will have 20 of them. Since it is random, it forces the play-through to be different every time.</p>

A very important game to me. If money were no issue, this would be the game that I would make.</p>

<p>Both games are exactly what they sound like. Simple, easy games.</p>
